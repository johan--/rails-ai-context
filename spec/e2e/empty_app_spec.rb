# ApplicationController, no routes beyond root. Every built-in tool MUST
# handle this gracefully (return a structured "no X found" response, not
# crash with NoMethodError or raise an exception).

# This is the harshest stress test for tools that assume Rails app
# fixtures exist. If a tool crashes here, it'll crash on any greenfield
# Rails app that hasn't started building features yet — which is exactly
# the moment a developer is most likely to install rails-ai-context.
